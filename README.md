#  Homee

Home dashboard for iPad. Currently limited to what I've built for my own purposes, but might be fun to add
extensibility for other uses too.

## Getting started

It's a plain Xcode project. No other dependencies.

1. Get your own keys for API's used
  - Trafiklab: ResRobot - Reseplanerare & ResRobot Stolptidtabeller 2 (https://www.trafiklab.se/)
2. Copy `Secrets.sample.swift` to `Secrets.swift` and add your API keys
